# Requirements

Main screen:
- [ ] main screen with search box
- [x] search for companies in own database (database stores at least 5 companies as examples)

Result page:
- [x] company + additional info pre-stored in database (evidence of social responsibility)
- [x] perceived reputation (or responsibility score) based on user submissions (average of all submitted scores)
- [x] info box (data retrieved from wikipedia)
- [ ] map with location of company (headquarters) - ideally retrieved via an API (Google Places for example), acceptable if predefined in database

Somewhere else (we didn’t specify):
- [ ] allow users to submit their perceived reputation of a certain company (only for companies in the database)
—> suggestion: you could include that in the result page, possibly giving the users the possibility to vote before they see the average score (so the option would be to vote, or to see the average recorded score)

Not required for minimal assignment:
- [ ] any type of user authentication (and no validation of multiple votes per user)
- [ ] any type of automatically searching for evidence of social responsibility
- [ ] google news stories
