# Programming Project Proposal
Alaa Abdelfattah and Lucas Braun

## CSR Lookup
*A javascript web application intended to demonstrate our programming abilities and hopefully do something interesting too.*

### About
Acting with social responsibility means acting in a way that benefits society at large. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) is when a business maintains a positive impact on the environment and all the people impacted by its activities, including consumers, employees, investors, and local communities.

Many people want to know if the corporations with which they do business are socially responsible, or at least not socially irresponsible. We propose developing a website where users can look up corporations, see basic information and news about the company, and help determine whether or not the firm is socially responsible.

### Proposed Functionality
#### The basics…
*This is the functionality we commit to finishing by December 1st.*

Structure (see mock-ups for details):
- Home page
  - Search box
- Search results page
- Company info page
  - Wikipedia info box
  - Informational content and ratings pulled from database

Technology and APIs:
- Angular JS
- Bootstrap for front-end
- Node.js for back-end
- PostgreSQL for database
- Wikipedia API to pull in publicly available information

#### If we have time…
*This is the additional functionality we would like to add if we have time.*

- User functionality (account authentication, ability to contribute content, ratings, reviews, comments)
- Maps to represent companies geographically
